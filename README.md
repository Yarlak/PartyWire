# PartyWire
This is a dependency management framework written in C# for scenes created with the Unity Game Engine. Very similar idea to how dependency injection works in the Spring Framework (used for developing web api's in Java).

Dependencies of a class that are decorated with the 'PartyWired' attribute can be easily resolved for newly instantiated objects without having to pass these dependencies through a class's constructor.

The ***src*** folder contains all the scripts needed for the dependency management system. And the ***Demo*** folder shows an example of how you can implement this system with some simple C# classes.
