# PartyWire
This is a dependency management framework written in C# for scenes created with the Unity Game Engine. Very similar idea to how dependency injection works in the Spring Framework (used for developing web api's in Java).

Dependencies of a class that are decorated with the 'PartyWired' attribute can be easily resolved for newly instantiated objects without having to pass these dependencies through a class's constructor.

# Contents
src   - contains all the scripts needed for the dependency management system
Demo  - contains an example of this framework could be implemented

To use these scripts simply copy them into the Assets folder of your Unity Project
